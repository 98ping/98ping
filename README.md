## Who am I
Hey, I am 98ping and I am self taught kotlin and java developer who likes to make open-source projects that are free-to-use and have comparable features to paid plugins.
All important things that I think deserve to be on my homepage are there so if you want to look at my code and maybe even use it go all for it.

## Does my code suck?
If it does then create an issue / dm me on discord (98ping#3040) to tell me how to improve my development. I am always looking for people to give me suggestions and it is why I am here where I am today.
