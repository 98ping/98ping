# 98ping

## Who am I
Hey, I am 98ping and I have worked on servers for about 2 years and I own my own (Kira Network) and operate others. I have a lot of experience in MineHQ plugins and framework development as that is what I have worked with for a majority of my short development lifetime.

##Talents
I am in the process of learning kotlin and have a general understanding of how it works but I mainly use java as it is easier to understand. I enjoy creating minigame frameworks that carry data from a parent server to child servers for games such as bedwars, skywars, smaller games, tntrun, and more. 

##Does my code suck?
If it does then create an issue / dm me on discord (98ping#3040) to tell me how to improve my development. I am always looking for people to give me suggestions and it is why I am here where I am today.
